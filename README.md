# What's For Dinner

This project is born out figuring out a good way for my wife and me
to plan our meals for the week. I like to stay organized and have a 
plan and a shopping list when we go to the grocery store.

So far, there hasn't been a great way for us to plan the week together
and compile the shopping list if we weren't in the same room. This project
seeks to be a remedy for that.
